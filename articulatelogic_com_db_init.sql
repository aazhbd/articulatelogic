We gained our clients\' loyalty due to micromanagement approach, high standards of quality, strong people development policy and business flexibility, qualities we try to implement and improvise day after day.</p>\r\n<p>The power behind Articulate Logic is its experienced and energetic team. Software engineers at ArticulateLogic perform research, code design, development, maintenance, and support covering the concept-to-market needs of the product. We thoroughly analyze all the requirements related to the product applying the combination of deep technical expertise, experience in the field, business domain knowledge, and proven approaches in order to develop a solution that satisfies requirements. We have a proven model of working directly with our clients. We respect and protect the confidentiality and safety of intellectual property of our clients.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What We Do</strong></h2>\r\n<p>At ArticulateLogic, we implement the engineering methods and processes to ensure the quality, security and stability of our products. The quality of our products and satisfaction of our clients are our major concerns. To achieve this, we create and improvise our development platform and methods of engineering based on the industry leading methodology.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have been identifying, developing, and advocating practices to improve all aspects of software. At ArticulateLogic, we emphasize defect prevention through improvement of process and product quality during the early phases of system development. We believe you should design quality into software, not test and patch it. At ArticulateLogic, we\'re developing innovative software technologies to meet today\'s challenges and tomorrow\'s opportunities.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>\r\n<p>We have a highly efficient, experienced and energetic team of people working together for decades. Hiring and retaining outstanding people is the key to our success. The team comprises of developers, analysts, designers, architects and managers who are striving towards providing techno-commercially sound, state of the art and cost-effective software solutions to our clients. Our team also comprises of a community of developers whose contribution to Articulatelogic is valued and encouraged. They contribute to ArticulateLogic by submitting codes, reviews, comments, bug report and bug fixes actively. Even our visitors contribute to our development process with their suggestion and feedback.</p>\r\n<p>ArticulateLogic has 24/7 development cycle; programmers are working on a project night and day. Each and every project development is being perused using feed forward communication approach with the clients for any assigned task; project managers play here a vital role in making the programmers apprehend the tasks. Open communication and a high level of customer care are the key to our ability to deliver complex solutions within the shortest possible time frame.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>\r\n<p>National infrastructures and utilities rely on computer-based systems and electrical products include a computer controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is completely computerized, as is the financial system. Therefore producing and maintaining software-costs effectively is essential for the functioning of national and international economies.</p>\r\n<p>The developments of this software require proper software engineering approach whose focus is the cost effective development of high-quality software systems. Software is abstract and intangible. It cannot be constrained by materials, or governed by physical laws or by manufacturing processes. There is no single ideal approach to software engineering. The wide diversity of different types of systems and organizations that use these systems means that we need a diversity of approaches to software development. This also means that we shall always have rooms for research and development in software engineering approaches and this is a never ending cycle that shall continue for generations and benefit human lives constructively in all phases.</p>\r\n<p>We therefore at ArticulateLogic are always inspired to improvise the state of the art in software engineering. We believe that the best way to ensure the security of software is to design, develop, and integrate software in a way that does not allow defects into software in the first place. Investments in up-front discipline and sound processes increase quality and security and decrease cost and risk.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Ideology</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Our vision is to lead the world to a software facilated civilization. We have facilities for extensive and creative researches and developments in our Research and Development facility and thus we are enthusiastic to empower our software industry and developers with latest technologies and expertise. The consequences of our efforts are the software that we create which act as examples of our collaboration and innovation. We are determined to create software that is pertinent to the requirement and attributed with the reputation of excellent software engineering efforts that is valuable to the humanity at all times.</p>',	'',	'',	0,	0,	'2016-05-15 14:26:46',	'0000-00-00 00:00:00',	0),
(2,	1,	1,	'methodology',	'Methodology',	'We endeavor to improvise our works and technology to develop quality software to the best of our knowledge',	'<h2><strong>Agile Software Development</strong></h2>\r\n<p>ArticulateLogic team have successfully adopted <em><strong>Agile software development methodology</strong></em> and use it at work selectively depending on the project scope and customer\'s requirements. Agile proved to be a cost-wise and efficient methodology for software projects that are vulnerable to emergent changes.</p>\r\n<p>Agile methods emphasize face-to-face communication over written documents. Our Agile team members are located in the same office, which promotes prompt knowledge sharing and better understanding of urgent issues. Each team may include programmers, product managers, business analysts, QA members, interaction designers, technical writers, and other specialists as per project scope.</p>\r\n<p>The ArticulateLogic\'s methodology unites talent &amp; passion with discipline. It ensures that projects are executed on budget and on time. This allows for true client-to-project transparency and a streamlined workflow from concept to execution.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"principles\"><strong>Principles</strong></h2>\r\n<p>ArticulateLogic put into practice the following <strong><em>Agile Manifesto Principles</em></strong>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<div><em>- Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Working-software is the principal measure of progress</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Regular adaptation to changing circumstances</em></div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We view software development as an engineering task. The software product as part of your business demands reliable solutions capable of generating consistent results. By implementing a well-defined development process we made project success a matter of fact, not chance.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"design\"><strong>Design and Development</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Because your product never stops evolving, our development process is iterative. The development process cycles through three phases: <em><strong>Analyze &amp; Plan, </strong></em><em><strong>Develop &amp; Test </strong>and </em><em><strong>Launch &amp; Monitor</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The other two key components of the process are <em>ongoing tasks: </em><em><strong>Support &amp; Maintenance </strong>and </em><em><strong>Promotion.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Although they evolve throughout the life cycle of the project, these elements are a permanent presence.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Analyze &amp; Plan</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Review: </strong></em>We find out what worked, so that we can build on that. We also find out what did not work, to fix it or replace it. This information is extremely valuable, because it comes directly from your interaction with your target audience.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Analysis: </strong></em>We help you refine and detail the goals and vision for your organization and project expectations in order to find out what it takes to achieve them. The result is a list of specific requirements. Each item on this list is rated based on how important and how urgent its contribution will be to the success of the project.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Planning: </strong></em>We plan the project blue-print that defines the specifications for the components that will be implemented and the required investment at each milestone. With your approval, we move on to implementing this plan.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Develop &amp; Test</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prototypes: </strong></em>Functional and visual prototypes allow you to get a glimpse at how your new product will work and look, before we even start to build it. Prototyping facilitates communication and helps us get it right first time, every time.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Development: </strong></em>Development stage starts off with the our software design concepts which become page layouts. Parallely, software components are developed, configured and connected to create the engine under the hood of your new software. Text, pictures, animations and downloadable files become your software content as they are carefully loaded and groomed into place.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Testing: </strong></em>Each component is carefully tested on its own during development and configuration, then again as part of the completed system. You have access to a real-life testing environment, to perform your own review of the software.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Launch &amp; Monitor</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Beta-Testing: </strong></em>This stage is a public test, reserved for a relatively small number of users, usually by invitation only. The beta-test is especially useful for software with advanced functionality, because it can reveal new information about real-life user expectations and experience. This information often leads to new requirements, and decisions need to be made as to if and when the changes will be made.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Launch: </strong></em>Revealing your new software to the world is a simple task from a technical perspective. When planned properly, it is basically a matter of flipping a switch. From the business point of view, there is usually much more to it. Marketing and public relations campaigns are often planned and executed around this event, to capitalize on the excitement of moment.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Monitor: </strong></em>Once your software is deployed and running, we make sure it stays in top shape. In case of websites we monitor it for both technical and business performance. Besides ensuring everything is always running smoothly, we periodically review the results you enjoy and compare them to your goals.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Support &amp; Maintenance</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This is more than just a step in the development process. It is the very foundation upon which all our services are built. You will experience dependable and friendly support from the very first contact and throughout the life of the project.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Support: </strong></em>Because of our proactive approach, our clients rarely need to call on our support services, but when they do they get the best there is. We continuously work towards finding new and better ways to solve your problems.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Training: </strong></em>Our software is so straight forward and intuitive that anybody who is comfortable using office applications knows everything they need to be productive with our application from day one. However, a quick tour and some assisted hands-on practice on real-life tasks can only help. That&rsquo;s why we provide training for your staff members who will use our software.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Maintenance: </strong></em>To keep your software running smoothly we have set up strict procedures for regular maintenance, upgrades and backups.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"devtools\"><strong>Development Tools</strong></h2>\r\n<p>ArticulateLogic always utilizes the state-of-the-art technologies available to develop any website or product. We do not compromise quality of our software and hence we are determined to utilize our workforce to design and develop sophisticated products.</p>\r\n<p>The following are some tools and technologies that we have used to design and develop our products in the past years, such as:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>PHP</strong></em>, <em><strong>Python</strong></em>, <em><strong>C</strong></em>, <em><strong>C++</strong></em>, <em><strong>Visual C#</strong></em>, <em><strong>Microsoft .NET framework</strong></em>, <em><strong>Java</strong> </em>and <em><strong>SQL</strong> </em>for databases <em><strong>MS SQL Server</strong></em>, <em><strong>MySQL</strong></em>, <em><strong>Postgre SQL</strong></em>, <em><strong>Oracle</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Microsoft Access</strong></em> on various frameworks as <strong>symphony2</strong>, <strong>laravel</strong>, <strong>drupal</strong>, <strong>cakephp</strong>, <strong>codeigniter</strong>, <strong>joomla</strong>, <strong>wordpress</strong>, <strong>bootstrap</strong>, <strong>smarty</strong>, <strong>twig</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong> etc.</p>\r\n<p>ArticulateLogic places a special focus on preserving a wide technical skill set, while retaining an exceptional level of technical expertise. ArticulateLogic\'s engineers have in-depth experience in a broad array of software development technologies.</p>\r\n<p>In order to make sure the customer receives fully functional user-friendly application on time and within budget, we at ArticulateLogic undertake the following steps:</p>\r\n<div><em>- Use open-source components</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Employ frameworks of our own where appropriate</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Include third-party software components if appropriate</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Apply coding standards and guidelines</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Utilize standard IDEs</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Design scalable, performance-optimized database</em></div>\r\n<div><em>- Follow application security standards</em></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 id=\"scope\"><strong>Development Scope and Benefits</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Our goal is to make sure that each customer is fully satisfied with the service and product delivered.

While the off-line options are well known, here is a glimpse into the most effective on-line traffic generators.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>- Search engine optimization (SEO)</em><br /><em>- Search engine advertising</em><br /><em>- On-line marketing</em></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many other opportunities to promote your website on-line: getting listed in relevant directories, contributing articles and advertising in industry-specific electronic magazines, publishing your own corporate newsletter or blog.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taken separately, each of these actions will bring far less traffic to your website than what search engines can generate. However, in the right mix, they are not only a profitable promotional strategy, but they will also help improve the position of your website in the search engine result pages.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"advertising\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Web Advertising Solution</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our team can help our customers to advertise their website in order to promote their business and productivity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Successful search engines are actually in the business of advertising.
